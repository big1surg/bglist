I'm at dice tower west, waiting for a friend to bring back a game from the conventions library of over 3k games. It could be anything. A light game, medium game…But I know it is going to be a heavy game. 
</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>
He walks over with Antiquity, a Splotter Game. I just purchased Horseless Carriage - another game by Splotter - but I’m trying to offload it because based on reviews and playthroughs I don’t see myself playing it.
</p><br/><br/>
<p>
After 4 years in this hobby, I have come to understand what I play and what my group plays may not always be the same, but if I want to play something, I have to choose based on the latter. 
</p><br/><br/>
<p>
I forgot to mention that it’s roughly 9 pm and Lisette (my fiancee) and I have been playing games since roughly noon. No biggie though as we’re being taught the game…right? Well, my buddy has only played once and so he has to go over the rules and setup before he can even teach. Welp, there goes an hour and it is now 10 pm. I can feel the time ticking and my eyelids getting heavier. Next to him is my other friend who happens to be his significant other. I look at her and her eyelids are definitely heavy, so are Lisette’s. 
</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>
My buddy clears his throat, a signal that the rules teach will begin. 
</p><br/><br/>
<p>
I may not sound excited but I am, even with the current time. I have had Antiquity on my Wishlist ever since I first played a Splotter game. I haven’t been able to play it up to this point because Splotter doesn’t feel the need to reprint it, I can’t tell you why. Anyway, my buddy is setting up the game, chits everywhere showing a large white border with icons that look like they have the resolution of a bean, whatever that may mean. I guess what it means is the game is kind of ugly. It looks like it was printed at home in 1995 when DPI wasn’t a thing. But it has a charm to it, it’s so ugly it's good looking. 
</p><br/><br/>
<p>
The teach is over, and we start playing the game. The first big decision …what do I put in my city in a game I do not yet understand the consequences of my decisions? My buddy who has played this once before advises everyone what he is doing…but why would I do that? Lisette and our other friend follow suit but not me…I’m a rule breaker. I ignore his advice and 2 hours later…I realized my mistake. It actually took more like 15 minutes when I got my first grave in my city but another hour until my entire city was covered in graves. I lost, which is funny because Splotter uses the following phrase in regards to losing if you have too many graves “it rarely happens”. It rarely happens? It just happened! It was 100% likely to happen, that doesn’t feel rare. It’s midnight and I am out of the game because I couldn’t keep up with famine. My city ran out of space and I couldn’t build a hospital to get rid of those graves. I thought it more effective to deal with pollution than with the bodies growing in my city. I still feel the consequences of my choices and that is why I write this. Antiquity may be one of the best games I have ever played. How could I have played differently? Should I have been so bold as to do something no one else was doing? Why build a granary to deal with famine if I have workers bringing home food and food counteracts famine? 
</p><br/><br/>
<p>

Imagine a game so good that it causes me to write a blog post. Imagine a game so good that I want to play again even after losing the game due to a pile of bodies. Imagine a game so good I had to go out and find it, buy it, own it. A game so good I decided to keep Horseless Carriage and find a Print and Play of Indonesia - another Splotter game they don’t want to Reprint. I will play again and I will not let my city down.
